# Parallel-Romberg-Integration
Faster Integration using parallel processing.
* This was done as a course project for DS 295: Parallel Programming in Department of Computational and Data Sciences, Indian Institute of Science. In this project we have shown that parallel implementation of Romberg Integration on hybrid systems works faster and more accurate than its sequential implementation. For more details kindly refer to the report in this repository.
